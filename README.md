# graph-ml

This repository contains our from-scratch implementations of several graph machine learning (ML) algorithms for our tutorial at Oxford University on graph ML. All code and experiments for each assignment is included in a well-documented `.ipynb` notebook.

1. In Assignment 1 (`Assignment1.ipynb`), we implement the translational knowledge graph embedding model [**TransE**](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/1cecc7a77928ca8133fa24680a88d2f9-Paper.pdf) for use in knowledge graph completion tasks. We benchmark the model's performance using mean rank, mean reciprocal rank, and hits@K on the [Nations](https://github.com/ZhenfengLei/KGDatasets/tree/master/Nations) dataset.
2. In Assignment 2 (`Assignment2.ipynb`), we implement a [**graph convolutional network**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907.pdf) (GCN) using first-degree filters and a compact message-passing framework for node classification. We also implement sample-based mini-batching following the approach proposed in the paper that introduces [GraphSAGE](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/5dd9db5e033da9c6fb5ba83c7a7ebea9-Paper.pdf). Finally, we benchmark using classification accuracy on the Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed citation network datasets (pulled from [`PyTorch Geometric`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/datasets.html#torch_geometric.datasets.Planetoid)--[associated paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08861.pdf)).
