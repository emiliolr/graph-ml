# graph-ml

This repository contains our from-scratch implementations of several graph machine learning (ML) algorithms for our tutorial at Oxford University on graph ML. All code and experiments for each assignment is included in a well-documented `.ipynb` notebook.

1. In Assignment 1 (`Assignment1.ipynb`), we implement the translational knowledge graph embedding model **TransE** for use in knowledge graph completion tasks. We benchmark the model's performance using mean rank, mean reciprocal rank, and hits@K on the Nations dataset.
2. In Assignment 2 (`Assignment2.ipynb`), we implement a graph convolutional network (GCN) using first-degree filters and a compact message-passing framework for node classification. We also implement sample-based mini-batching following the approach proposed in this paper. Finally, we benchmark using classification accuracy on the Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed citation network datasets.
